## 🚀 The Vision
**WeilChain Nexus** is not just a marketplace; it's an **execution layer for the decentralized web**. By bridging on-chain logic with off-chain computation, we enable users to build complex, verifiable workflows—**Pipelines**—that combine AI, data processing, and financial transactions into a single, seamless experience.

Traditional DApps are siloed. Nexus is **composable**. 
Imagine taking a *Sentiment Analysis Applet*, piping its output into an *Automated Trading Bot*, and logging the result forever on the WeilChain blockchain. **That is Nexus.**

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧩 **Applet Marketplace**
Discover a growing ecosystem of micro-services. From **AI Summarizers** to **Data Sanitizers**, finding the right tool is just a search away. Developers can monetize their code by registering applets directly on-chain.

### 🔗 **Visual Pipeline Builder**
No coding required. Drag, drop, and connect applets to build powerful workflows.
*   **Input**: Text, Images, CSVs.
*   **Process**: Chain multiple applets logic together.
*   **Output**: Actionable insights logged immutably.

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Integrations**
Nexus ships with built-in AI capabilities. Run **Sentiment Analysis** and **Text Summarization** locally in the browser, verifiable by the community.

### 📜 **Immutable Execution Logs**
Every pipeline run is recorded on the **WeilChain**. Trust, but verify. We provide a transparent audit trail of every computation, ensuring accountability in a decentralized world.

## 🏆 Innovation & Impact

WeilChain Nexus solves the **fragmentation problem** in Web3. By standardizing input/output schemas for applets, we allow disparate tools to talk to each other. This opens the door for:
*   **Automated DAO Governance** based on social sentiment.
*   **Decentralized content moderation** pipelines.
*   **Trustless financial reporting** from raw data input.

**Built for the Hackathon. Ready for the World.**
